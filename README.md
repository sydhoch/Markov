# Markov
 This project offers an occasionally amusing look at text by using a Markov process to generate random text based on a training text. This process can be used to identify SPAM or to ascertain if Bacon wrote Romeo and Juliet.

 Most of the code was given to me. My job was to:
	1 - implement "EfficientMarkov", a faster version of the brute-force version given to me, using maps rather than rescanning the training text. 
	2 - create a class "WordGram" that uses word-markov model instead of character-markov model.
	3 - create "EfficientWordMarkov" which doesn the same thing as EfficientMarkov but uses WordGram.
	4 - create more tests to test WordGram and EfficientWordMarkov.
